Horizon Scanning Hackathon

##Horizon Scanning

Horizon Scanning is the systematic outlook to detect early signs of potentially important developments.
These can be weak (or early) signals, trends, wild cards or other developments, persistent problems, risks and threats, including matters at the margins of current thinking that challenge past assumptions.
The next two days hopes to answer the question of whether Horizon Scanning can be automated and enhanced using coding and AI

## Starting Resources

There are several APIs that allow us to access scientific papers:

https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/index.html

https://dev.springernature.com/documentation

https://api.plos.org/solr/examples/

There are also Python libraries to help automatically retrieve papers. PyPaperBot is an example of this.
